Integration Event Outbox process
----------------

1. DbContext.Save gets called in CommandHandler

2. Db context collects pending DomainEvents from entities and dispatches them
    - DomainEvent handlers get fired
    - Aggregates in each bounded context update state
    - DomainEvent handlers may put IntegrationEvents into IntegrationEventService.Queue

3. Db context copies IntegrationEvents from queue to database table IntegrationEventOutbox and marks them as PENDING

4. DbContext commits changes, transaction ends

5. DbContext calls IntegrationEventService.PublishQueue

6. As each IntegrationEvent is processed, it gets marked in the outbox as SENT
    - Optionally, track retry count, etc.

Need:
    - IIntegrationEventService, IntegrationEventService
    - IEventOutboxService, EventOutboxService
	- EventOutBox class to persist
    - IServiceBus, ServiceBusAzure
