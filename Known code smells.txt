KNOWN CODE SMELLS

----------
SSar.Contexts.XXX.Application projects reference SSar.Contexts.Common.Data

These references are required because we are injecting dbContexts (AppDbContext) into the command 
handlers but Microsoft does not make interfaces available for the contexts. Therefore, I have
to inject the concrete AppDbContext which is in the Data project.

A future workaround would be to create a facade interface for AppDbContext and use that for DI.

Right now I'm sticking with the concrete class as the only thing it's really costing me is that
I can't combine the Application and Domain projects into one project for each BC. Doing so would
get me a circular reference. And, having separate projects enforces proper uncoupling of the domain
layer so it's no real loss anyway.


-----------
OperationResult

First, I need to make operation result immutable. Next, I need to reconsider
how I'm creating it and merging results in the Aggregate base class.

I've got a solution that works well for now, but am going to start work on
something else for awhile and come back to it later to see it in a new light.
