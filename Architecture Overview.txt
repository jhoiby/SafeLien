ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

DOMAIN EVENTS

Domain events are used to communicate between aggregates within a bounded context. They are propogated
using Jimmy Bogard's MediatR package and execute synchronously with each command to maintain immediate
consistency within the bounded context.

INTEGRATION EVENTS

Integration events are published on an event bus and executed asynchronously, therefore communication
between bounded contexts is done with "eventual consistency". This system is still under design.
