Variances from standard DDD/BC patterns

- Contexts.Common project
    - Saves developer overhead by sharing code common to all contexts.

- Uses single database for all contexts
	- Allows for integration to be synchronously handled by internal domain events and saves a layer of
	    implementation complexity by avoiding guaranteed asynchronous integration message handling
		for each bounded context, which would add a huge amount of database transaction overhead
		for a single-server based application.
